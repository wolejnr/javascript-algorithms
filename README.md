Solved algorithms using JavaScript

I have become fascinated with the JavaScript language of late. This is because of how it seems to differ from 
languages (such as C/C++, Java, PHP and Python) that I have worked with prior to this time. Being an enthusiatic
learner and one that is bent on honing my Web Development skills I stumbled upon the [100DaysOfCode challenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash). I intended to work with Python in developing Web Applications but most of the tutorials I tried to follow were too confusing to follow hence I started to look for alternatives until I stumbled upon [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org). The redesigned site is now better structured to help one determine where s/he is at in the learning pyramid. This repository is where I will store all the algorithms I work on from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
